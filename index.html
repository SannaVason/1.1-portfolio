		<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> I am a Nebraskan sourced student on my way to becoming a software developer through Thinkful.

  <br>
<p>	Before I found out how fun and challenging coding was, I tried a few education paths to see what was for me, some of those things were:</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  It took a handful of years before I figured out where I was meant to go in life. I drifted in through different educations, good at all of them, but not excited for any of them. Then I attempted full stack development in a collegiate space, but quickly recoiled after my professor told me I would be an embarrassment to myself and those that taught me, because of my learning disabilities. A couple years later, I rediscovered coding through my spouse and friends who work in the game development industry and ended up thriving here at Thinkful.

  <br>
  Outside of a screen, I read books of all kinds and annotate them if possible. When I don't have my nose in a book, I've got my pen to a page writing poetry and short stories.
